Loved the foie gras, but the caesar salad was so-so even though they prepared it at the table according to my husband's specifications. Our entree were steaks and seabass which were really really good. They had two special wines featured that month and we decided on one (they let us taste both wines before we decided) which accompanied our meal perfectly.

Chicken and artichoke hearts marinated in a zesty dressing were superb. Ravioli stuffed with banana squash, topped with crumbled amaretti and floating in sage sauce, Risotto al Neri di Sepia (black risotto, tinted with squid ink), and Spaghetti a la Bottarga di Trapani (in a sauce composed of olive oil, garlic, chili, and tuna roe) were dishes that both surprised and pleased our palates.

Clearly, if a restaurant is offering too much for too little, in order to show a profit, something needs to be sacrificed - and usually it's the quality of the food. There are a bountiful number of choices here, a few of them actually edible, but for the most part the cuisine borders on the disastrous. You can't go wrong if you stick to the salad bar, where everything is fresh. It's the hot buffet selections that are the kitchen's downfall. Salt appears to be the only seasoning in use here, and there's far too much of it in everything. Roast chicken was dangerously undercooked, whereas the bourbon chicken was burnt and tough. Meatloaf contained more bread filler than it did meat. The pot roast was fatty, overdone, too dry, and tasteless. Fries were perfect, but mashed potatoes needed to be doctored quite a bit. Pizza was underbaked, leaving the dough white and chewy. Steaks were precooked, then thrown on the grill to heat up, making rare impossible and medium rare unlikely. Desserts are plentiful and, for the most part, very good - just avoid the soft serve ""ice cream,"" which has a peculiar texture and taste. The noise level is very high at peak dining times, and negotiating your way between tables and through the various food lines can be treacherous in a crowd. Sunday brunch earns an extra star; obviously they do eggs far better than anything more ambitious.

In addition to a wide array of salad fixings for do-it-yourselfers, the restaurant offers ready-made Caesar and Oriental Chicken salads as standards and a few specialty salads that change every ten days or so. These tend to lean towards the ""exotic"" - greens with pears, walnuts, and gorgonzola or a spicy Southwestern pasta salad, for example - and are never disappointing. The restaurant's strong point is definitely its soups, always made strictly from fresh ingredients, perfectly spiced, and overloaded with vegetables and whatever other ingredients it contains. Here, too, the specialties rotate - a recent Mexican meatball soup was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken soup - a staple - is filled with huge chunks of breast meat and thick homemade noodles. Chili is thick and spicy. There are always three pasta selections, but these tend to be less successful, usually dry and overcooked. Foccacio and pizza (too often underbaked or overdone), a variety of muffins, and baked potatoes with all the extras are also available. Fresh fruit, pudding, and soft serve yogurt for make-your-own sundaes comprise the desserts. The addition of a fruit cobbler doesn't warrant the higher price charged after 4:00pm, since all other menu items remain the same. A major problem with this location is its layout. New diners leaving the register enter directly into the area where people are picking up their soup, pasta, breads, and yogurt, and the result at peak dining times is a traffic jam, if not actual collisions involving food-laden trays, and tables are too close to each other. Best time to visit is between 2 and 4:00pm to avoid the crowds and increased noise level.",2005-07-14 18:40:04,positive,positive,2005

A deck provides a beautiful setting for alfresco dining, although eating outdoors is highly impractical in the hot and humid weather that generally prevails from May through October. The regular menu is a blend of Continental and Pacific Rim cuisines with a Pan-Asian flair. However, for two reasons, the best time to dine here is on Sunday - the extensive buffet is self-service, meaning you don't need to deal much with the frequently arrogant and usually maddeningly slow service, and for a price lower than that of many of the dinner entrees, you can indulge in a wonderful feast with live entertainment. Priced at $19.95 for adults (who receive a Mimosa or glass of champagne) and $8.95 for children (who often can outeat their parents), it includes a wide assortment of typical breakfast items - Eggs Benedict, Belgian Waffles, French Toast, fruit-filled blintzes, donuts, muffins, and a variety of breads. An omelet station prepares them to order, and serves them with sausage, bacon, and wok-fried potatoes. Seafood selections include smoked salmon, sushi rolls, easy-peel shrimp, Cajun crawfish, and half-shell oysters. Those looking for heartier fare will find carved ham and roast beef, assorted hot and cold entrees, international cheese platters (including baked brie), fresh pate, fresh garden and prepared salads, and seasonal fresh fruits. Those with a sweet tooth will delight in the dessert table, laden with cakes, pies, and pastries, specialties such as Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Foster, and create-it-yourself ice cream sundaes.

Aside from a few bizarre options, such as an American-style salad bar and an odd-tasting, underbaked pizza, the selections are typical of what one expects to find in a venue like this. Considering the reasonable price, the surprising addition is a well-stocked fresh seafood and sushi bar. There's a wide assortment of appetizers - including stuffed mushrooms, crispy egg rolls, and fried wontons filled with cream cheese - and three different soups. In addition to the usual chicken, pork, beef, and seafood entrees (the lemon shrimp is particularly outstanding, and there's an interesting hot crab with mayonnaise dish worth trying), there's a roast loin of pork on a carving board. There's fried and white rice and lo mein for those who crave carbs. A wide array of desserts include several fresh fruit selections, rice pudding, pastries, and ice cream. Service is perfunctory, and waitresses tend to bring the check long before diners are finished eating. We simply ignored it and continued to plow through the items we hadn't yet sampled. Dinner prices are higher, without any additions to the buffet selections, a common practice that's one of my pet peeves.

Originally a grist mill dating back to 1790, the building - threatened with demolition - was purchased by a group of individuals, including playwright Moss Hart, for the purpose of presenting a summer theater program in the bucolic town of New Hope, a weekend retreat for Philadelphia and New York City residents. It opened in July 1939, and rapidly developed a reputation as the country's premier playhouse. The classic play 'Harvey' and Neil Simon's 'Barefoot in the Park' (then titled 'Nobody Loves Me') both had runs here prior to their Broadway openings. Among the performers who have appeared here are Helen Hayes, Colleen Dewhurst, Shirley Booth, Lillian Gish, Grace Kelly, Robert Redford, Bert Lahr, Roddy McDowell, and Walter Matthau. Although run in a strictly professional manner, the building's ambiance is closer to that of a barn where Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, and friends would put on a show than that of a Broadway theater.

You might have missed this place walking by it. The restaurant has only 35 seats, a very cozy atmosphere as you would find in typical Italian restaurants. Buon Ricordo (good memory) ceramic plates on the wall remind you that this chef travels to Italy often to further immerse himself in food.

The menu is updated weekly and changes with the season. They also offer 6 and 8 course tasting menus during the summer. We called just a day before our visit (they book 2 months ahead) we were very lucky to get in! The chef and staff were so welcoming and treated us like royalty! Here's what we ate:

Antipasti - huge antipasto round with lots of yummy grilled, marinated vegetables, smoky cheeses, mixed greens with grana, and freshly sliced ethereal slices of prosciutto done a la minute and brought to our table. We also ordered the Crisp Suckling Pig with Roasted Corn antipasto that was so delicious! The chef also sent out the Foie Gras Pastrami with Cherry Mostarda (the foie gras is ""cured"" like pastrami - this was such an amazing dish!).

For pastas, we ordered the Mint Pappardelle with Lamb and Sweet Pea Ragu and the signature Spinach Gnocchi with Shaved Ricotta and Brown Butter. Lots of butter in the gnocchi sauce! The gnocchi were almost entirely made of spinach - and just so light and delicate. The chef also sent out a taste of the not-on-the-menu corn ravioli with shaved black summer truffles from italy. Divine!

We decided to share the main course  - another signature: Roasted Capretto (baby goat) with Soft Polenta - it was out of this world! Chef Marc Vetri presented each dish to us, and this was especially incredible - they roast the goat outdoors for hours. It was so tender!

I'm so annoyed with the pharmacy of the Rite Aid at Broad and Snyder. I seems that every month we have issues picking up our prescriptions.

Issues we've had:
- Prescription hasn't been filled yet, even though we submitted via the website 24 hours earlier.
- Prescription hasn't been filled yet because they are out of the drug. Very poor inventory control.
- Prescription has been filled, but they can't find where they filed it.
- Rude and beligerent pharmacists and cashiers.
- Transfered prescriptions to another store and go to pick it up and are told they never got the order.
- The last woman blamed me for them having inaccurate contact information in spite of my having just heard of it.  The number they'd been trying to call was disconnected over 2 years ago. When there have been issues why didn't someone ask for a new contact number?

It makes me sad.",2005-08-18 17:02:26,negative,negative,2005

But this was in fact a favorite of the grande dame of French cuisine, who spent her final years in upscale Montecito, the lush enclave of the rich and sometimes famous located at the eastern end of Santa Barbara. I'm not sure if Julia was forced to line up with the rest of the regulars who do just that, often up to an hour, all day long throughout the year. The tiny kitchen specializes in gourmetized versions of the street food sold on corners in sleepy little Mexican towns. There are no chips and dip here, nor is it a place where the same four ingredients are combined in twenty different preparations. Tamales are overloaded with corn, onions, chayote, and pasilla peppers. Tacos, made with thick, handmade corn tortillas, bear little resemblance to those found in Tex-Mex joints - taco de rajas is a mix grilled pasilla chiles and onions smothered with melted cheese, which also blankets the taco de calabacitas, a combination of tender marinated pork and stewed zucchini. The specialty of the house is a pasilla chile stuffed with grilled pork, roasted until it's just barely charred. Each item has its own texture and spices, and no two taste alike.

For dessert, the liquid-center chocolate cake with coffee ice cream and mint leaves and the fresh berry souffle were superb.

Mama Domilise still pinches me on the cheek when I go in.  Nicest people in the world, best po-boys in New Orleans hands down.  Worth particular mention are the shrimp, oyster, and shrimp/oyster ""half & half"".  Get the hot sauce that they put on behind the counter - I don't know what it is, but it ads a flavor that you can get nowhere else.  It was almost twenty years before I could tear myself away from those two po-boys to try anything else but one day on a lark I ordered the cheeseburger po-boy with everything.  It was a revelation.  It came stock with chili, hot sauce, and grilled onions making it the kind of drip-to-the-elbow mess that you might only want to consume alone or in the company of good friends.  Basically, it is the finest cheeseburger I have ever had.

Let me back up the preceding review regarding the beer.  I would never order so trashy a beer as Miller outside of this establishment, but served here nothing could hope to compliment your sandwich better.  Dirt cheap - a buck and change.  Served in a healthy sized thick glass goblet that Ray, the bartender, pulls out of a deep freezer and fills from a clean tap.  A thin layer of ice forms between the beer and the glass that slowly peels away from the chalice and drifts upwards through the beer as you eat your meal - an elegant visual that attests at a glance to the perfection of your beer's preparation and temperature.

It would usually start out at The Boot, meander over to The Metro, and invariably end up at Fat Harry's.  Towards the end of the summer we would still end up here, but I remember that we would just sit around drinking and musing on how bad it sucked.  How fucking tired we were of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and Steve Miller.  Yeah, there are a lot of fights, but don't mistake this place for a tough bar.  We're talking about a bunch of overstimulated local preps tearing each others Izods and getting all pink-faced from slapping each other while their girlfriends cry melodramatically for them to stop.  About half the time Biff is choking back tears of his own.  Yep, plenty of guys suffering severe testosterone poisoning looking for just the right corn-state princess having her first drink in the Big City and completely primed to do something she'll regret.  I know, I didn't seem to mind when I was he, but now it's just too pathetic to watch. 

Mitigating Factors that somehow pulled three stars out of me:

Drinks are pretty good.  The Bloody Mary in particular has a lot to be proud of.  The food isn't too bad either.  They have a great Cajun burger that isn't just a regular patty with a bunch of Chachere's, but actually has quality aduille ground into the meat.  Slide an extra couple of bucks to the dude at the grill and he'll cook it rare - despite the pork content.  The cheese fries are great - get mixed cheese and ranch to dip.  The buffalo wings are pretty good too.  They have tables out front that spare you the lameness that lurks within.  It's right on St. Charles and is really a very nice place for a pre-game bloody with friends.

The expansive dining room, situated in the former sanctuary, features a soaring ceiling, stained-glass windows, and other remnants of the building's former incarnation - upholstered church pews line perimeter walls as table seating, and a wooden railing still stands around the chancel, now an elevated dining area. Hurricane-style lamps echoing the jewel tones of the windows accent the linen-topped tables, and a floor-to-ceiling painting with Biblical overtones dominates the space where the altar once stood. Pardon the pun, but dining here is a near-religious experience. Marsha Brown has dug deep into her Louisiana roots and brought to her kitchen all the Cajun and Creole secrets passed down by previous generations of cooks, resulting in what is possibly the best New Orleans cuisine north of the Mason-Dixon line. For starters, petite blackened lamb chops were served with mango chutney, bayou snapper soup had a flavor as deep and rich as its chestnut brown tint, and the house salad, a blend of greens, carrot shreds, cherry tomatoes, and croutons - was enhanced by a creamy balsamic vinaigrette. Fried catfish, coated with panko bread crumbs, was free of any hint of oil, and a remoulade sauce was perfect for the mild fish. A broiled pork T-bone was topped with a delicious Jack Daniels-infused apple-raisin concassee. All agreed that the best entree was Eggplant Ophelia, a huge casserole crowded with eggplant, crabmeat, and shrimp brought to life with spicy seasonings. How fortunate that this was my selection, since I got to savor the bulk of it. Coconut amaretto cake, apple pot pie a la mode, and Granmere's Comfort Custard, with a sweetened cracker base, were fitting endings. Service was impeccable - almost reverential, if you will. In keeping with the prices - dinner for three, including tax, tip and nonalcoholic beverages, totaled $210 - the crowd tends to be older, well-dressed, and kid-free.",2005-09-25 14:39:12,positive,positive,2005

I had outstanding food at this Italian BYOB near Rittenhouse. Very fresh food especially the excellent seafood dishes and pastas. Great calamari and crab cake appetizers. All the main courses looked great and the red snapper special I had was darn good with warm soft polenta as a side. The desserts however were nothing special (you could find equivalent desserts at Costco). Portions were large for all courses. The service was atrocious even though the wait staff was nice and tried hard. It took over 15 minutes before we got our menues and then over 10 minutes after that before they even took our order. Water glasses were not refilled until we asked and we had to wait over a half hour between courses.

My companion and I decided that we would order our sandwich ""with whiz,"" which in Philly steak parlance means ""Give me a steak sandwich with onions and Cheese Whiz."" Other options are available, and some folks swear by American or Provolone cheese, but the legendary cheesesteak of my dreams, the cheesesteak of arcane power, the cheesesteak vilified by dead child molester and frugal gourmet Jeff Smith, the cheesesteak I've spied numerous times dancing across my always-tuned-to-the-Food Network television screen, has the bright yellow goo, the almost-dairy product that Kraft Corporation christened Cheese Whiz. I don't even like Cheese Whiz.

Well, it was pretty damn good.  Tidy, not the sloppy monster of a sandwich that Pat's King of Steaks offers, but good, nonetheless. The service, of course, was extra speedy, and the the young woman who handed us our drinks was incredibly rude.  I was expecting this.

Overall, a good, not-too-messy sandwich.",2005-10-30 02:19:54,neutral,negative,2005

Geno's was good, tidy, almost genteel. A nice mix of  whiz, onions, and meat.

Pat's, on the other hand, won points for sheer abundance. This thing was big. And messy (see photos). With about twice as much filling as Geno's, the flavor of the steak took center stage. I found Pat's to be a bit tastier, probably because the beef flavor came through more clearly. However, the bread was overwhelmed. I was overwhelmed too, with Cheese Whiz, mostly. Too much of the whiz is not necessarily a good thing.

I gave a marginal win to Pat's on the basis of bounty, (and because they had a better selection of condiments and ruder staff), but I would really need to eat a few more steaks to decide on a definite favorite. Right now, Geno's sounds pretty good.",2005-10-30 02:44:52,positive,positive,2005

Despite it being far from any pier, this sushi joint blew away all my negative expectations.

First of all, it was ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi for a mere $12! A roll by itself is about $7 already. So with the mantra of ""all you can eat sushi!"" in my head, I participated in gluttonous bliss. The sushi was absolutely great and differentiated itself from what I was used to in the bay. They had little twists to each of their rolls and had quirky names like the Marilyn Monroll (which I really enjoyed). If I remember correctly, the Marilyn is similar to a Philadelphia roll, but with tempura-fried tuna in the middle.. I would also try their spicy tuna handroll.. I don't really have to say anything about it.. just try it. :)

My first visit there was very enjoyable. The staff was very helpful and would substitute any sauce or ingredient for me. I enjoyed it so much that my family made the effort to go again right before we left Sparks.

It's usually pretty crowded and for good reason, the Mediterranean inspired cuisine is original and delicious. The menu is seasonal using meats and vegetables that the chef thinks are most fresh during that particular season. The menu is divided into 4 parts: flat breads, antipasta, small dishes, and large dishes. The flat breads typically have some cheese and vegetables. They seem to be a big hit, but weren't my thing because I only like simple cheese (yes, all cheese lovers can cringe). The small dishes provide a nice variety and include some salads. I had the PEI mussels which were perfectly cooked and a generous portion. The large dishes are mostly meats/poultry/fish though I think there was a vegetarian one. Most come with a starch of some sort. I had chicken with pomegranite molasses which was amazing. Pefectly cooked. The salmon and lamb my friends had were excellent as well. Desserts must rotate pretty often because they are written on a chalk board nearby. We split blackberry-apple bread pudding which was outstanding. I pretty much wanted to try all of them. IIRC there was also pumpkin pie, vanilla risotto pudding, and a pot de creme. Definitely worth checking out and very reasonably priced.

First visit: OK, I just found out about this place last week and I've already been there twice. But what's not to love about a 24-hour Mexican restaurant that beats Taco Bell and Del Taco any day of the week?! Nothing. That's what I thought. Let's see, a pretty good-sized burrito is $3.25. It's $0.29 more for cheese and sour cream (each). I'm also a fan of the meat plate, which is a scoop of rice, beans, meat of your choice, lettuce and four or five tortillas for $3.99. I know, you're mouth is watering right? I have yet to try the chorizo and eggs or huevos rancheros, (both $4.99) but I was told they only serve it in the morning until 11 a.m.

As for the dining area, it's got lots of tables and booths. It's nothing special to look at, well, except for the old school arcade games (i.e. Street Fighter and Pac Man).

So the next time you crave a Mexican pizza or Baja chalupa, slap yourself across the face, tell yourself Taco Bell sucks and try this joint. Your tastebuds will say ""gracias.""",2005-12-17 03:30:23,negative,negative,2005

Obviously sushi is prevalent on the menu given Morimoto's background, but the other Japanese style dishes like tempura with gorgonzola and the cooked fish dishes were incredible. We're big scallop fans and the hotate sushi was the best we have ever had, narrowly beating out a few places in Japan. Desserts were a little less impresive with a wasabi tiramisu being a very weird blend of flavors. Next time I go back, I will definitely try the chef's tasting menu, though we opted not to on this occasion since Morimoto, himself, was not there.",2005-12-19 18:44:54,positive,positive,2005

A friend introduced me to Tequila's and I have to say it is far and away the most authentic Veracruz style Mexican in Philly. It's right up there with El Vez as the best in my book. They have ample seating in the back for large parties, and good service. I almost felt like I was back in California while drinking the large margaritas, which the waitstaff carry on their heads. We also had some damn good sangria along with our meal of typical Mexican style fare.

The first thing I noticed was the small menu, it's good in that the chef tries to only make dishes with fresh ingredients, but bad in that it seriously limits your dining options. What I most remember was the good sauces that accompanied the decent cooking: my quail had a nice balsamic reduction and scallops had a saffron vermouth sauce. The wait staff was a little pushy, but all in all it was a good meal and definitely has a different sort of a menu than some of the other BYOs around.",2005-12-19 20:58:38,neutral,negative,2005

Let me start by saying that most like this play much better than I do. Many would give it 5 stars. Like most Starr restaurants Tangerine has a fun list of cocktails to choose from. Tangerine's drink menu has mainly upscale martinis, which were very good. Dinner was a mixed plate with the chef fully utilizing mediterranean flavors in items like chickpea crepes, pistacchio/raisin bread, shrimp afrique, moroccan shrimp, and red ssnapper with red pepper sauce. These flavors carried over to dessert as well in a pistacchio ice cream. It's not that Tangerine wasn't good, but it was just a little too unidimensional for me. I didn't think the flavors meshed as well together as at some of the other Starr restaurants.",2005-12-19 21:03:45,neutral,negative,2005

I had an excellent meal here, tucked into a comfortable corner of the restaurant. The service was excellent with the waiter knowing all the details of the menu. All the food was exceedingly fresh and you will find many ingredients that you don't find on other menues. We started with a mushroom flatbread that was excellent. A blue nose bass and parchment wrapped, coconut-miso salmon were cooked perfectly and full of flavor. They also have several sides which are good additions to the meal, including honey roasted sweet potatoes. Dessert was out of control good: pumpkin cheesecake and apple-cranberry cobbler with vanilla gelato. There was nothing left on the dessert plates when we were done.

That's the name of the guy who started this yummy pizza chain. If you're named Fred, you get some kinda deals on stuff there. What is it you ask? Well, I don't know. My name isn't Fred. But for any Freds out there, do let me know.

I first was introduced to this place because of the pesto chips ($4). The chips come shaped about the size of a personal pizza and covered in gooey cheese and pesto sauce. The flavor is not too overbearing and it's a nice little snack if you don't have much money. Ask for ranch.

I agree that the crust is actually good. It's kind of buttery, soft, doughy and doesn't taste like that burnt excuse for pizza crust that most chains serve. While all the toppings are good, I really like the sausage here. I knew the food was good here when a friend of mine who hates pizza tried some of my leftovers and then asked if we could order an x-large pizza to go.

Everything is decorated in early Americana. I guess it fits with Philadelphia.

The hotel itself is close to both the financial and retail areas. The downside? Pat's, Geno's and Jim's cheesesteak shops are over 7 miles away! Well luckily, there are cabs in Philly that will get you to that wiz covered goodness quick enough. :)",2005-12-21 20:40:18,positive,positive,2005

The Whistler and Sargent pieces (one of the most seductive and dark pieces of Sargent's career and an embarrasment to the socialite's who commissioned the piece family- she loved it- they strove to hide it. Eventually it was the first Sargent to be publicly purchased and displayed in any museum). Also, if you love epic pieces they have a great piece that depicts an old 19th century medical lecture where all the students are watching the body being examined- I believe by Thomas Eakins. It stands an impressive 15-20 ft high and even more ft wider. A beautiful Winslow Homer collection. Also they have the most STUNNING period world reconsruction rooms of Imperial China, Japan and French Louis the someteenth. 
When you're here, save the time to see some real treasures and avoid the Rocky trap. We went, we saw and were let down with those steps.  We were going to refilm the running up the steps and pumping the arms, but saw all the other losers doing it and thought better of it.

Enter hungry.

It's OK.  It's even good.  You sure get a lot of food for your money.  Surprisingly wide selection at the salad bar.  Big menu, very reasonably priced.  Lots of complete dinners.  Even better prices if you catch the Early Bird Specials.  Lots of handsome desserts, too.  And don't forget breakfast and lunch, too.  Be sure to read the billboards on the parking-lot wall.

You gotta love the '50s dinerness of the decor, gotta love the experience.

Smaller than the average diner.  It's on a congested (by local standards) shopping street, but there's off-street parking.  Quaker Diner is half a block from Five Points (intersection of Rising Sun, Oxford, and Cottman Aves.), so there are lots of buses nearby.  Heck, I've even WALKED there!

They're good people-- they donate catering to events at the Lawndale Methodist Church a block or two down Cottman Ave.  I'm no Methodist, but I go to some of the community meetings where local politicians give talks and Q&A sessions-- and afterwards help myself to a platter of that Quaker Diner catering while I shmooze with the other civic-minded souls.
